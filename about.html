<p>Hello, my name is Andr√© and I am a new grad from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas. I graduated in August with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the Lyle School of Engineering and am currently looking for opportunites to utilize my coding skills.</p>

<p>During my time in school I worked on various projects which have strengthened my skills not only in coding, but also in aspects such as communication and teamwork. You can read more about my projects both past and prospective in the <i>Projects</i> tab of this website.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy writing, drawing, and spending time with my family.</p>
