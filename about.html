<p>Hello, my name is Andr√© and I am a new grad from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas. I graduated in August with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the Lyle School of Engineering and am currently looking for opportunites to utilize my coding skills.</p>

<p>During my time in school I worked on various projects which have strengthened my skills not only in coding, but also in aspects such as communication and teamwork.</p>
