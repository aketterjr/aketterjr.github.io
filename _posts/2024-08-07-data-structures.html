<p>For this project, I constructed a search engine to find strings in text files utilizing C++. The program had to parse through text files, index the words and authors of the files into an AVL Tree, and search through the tree to locate files that the user searches for. By completing this project I gained valuable skills in Data Structures, Search Algorithms, Communication, and Teamwork.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>When the program first loads, the user is presented with the User Interface, where they can choose between various options.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Calling the supersearch function and loading the User Interface</span>

<p>The user has 3 choices they can make:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The user can upload text files to be indexed by the program. This is the first step if the program has never been run before, otherwise it will regenerate an AVL Tree from the last index it saved (as pictured above).</li>
    <li>An index the user has created can be removed. This should be done if the user wishes to delete the index they have already created.</li>
    <li>Lastly is the option to search the index, which is the main functionality of the program. The string that the user enters in will be used to find any files containing that keyword, as well as the amount of times that word appears in the articles (word count).</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">Creating an Index</h2>

<p>The first thing the user should do is create an index from the json files. These files will be parsed and the text will be inserted into an AVL Tree that will be used to search the documents.</p>

<!--<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->
<p>Following this, the user can decide if they want to save the index or not. If they choose to save the index, it will be stored and recreated the next time the program is run. Otherwise, it will only be used while the program is currently running. After the user has created an index, they can move on to the main fucntion of the software, which is searching through the files.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Searching Through Files</h2>

<p>When the user has created an index, they can then enter a string of text to find those words in a document. The search function can also take in the names of authors and publications, deliniated by special characters.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/supersearch.gif" alt="supersearch">
<span class="caption text-muted">Using the search function to find articles containing the word "german".</span>

<p>As seen above, the user entered a word they wished to search for and were given a list of files containing said word. If there is a large number of files, the user can switch between them in multiple tabs through the user interface. Furthermore, once the user has found a file they wish to see, they can simply select it by entering its number which will display the contents of the file. They can then close the file to return to the list of search results, and return to the search function to enter another query.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Removing an Index</h2>

<p>Lastly, the user can also remove an index after one has been created. This can be done if they wish to move to a different file directory or if they wish to save space on their computer.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Overall, this project was a great lesson in teamwork and communication. The search engine was a collaborative effort between me and a classmate of mine. We learned to communcate to ensure our commits on github were coordinated (ex: asking what changes each other had made) and also to divide the labor evenly between ourselves. We faced some challenges at first with coordinating our schedules, but ultiamtely we overcame these adversities and performed well on this project. These experiences have taught me valuable lessons that I will take into my professional career.</p>
