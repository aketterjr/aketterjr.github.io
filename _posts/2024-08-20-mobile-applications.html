<!-- <p>For this project, I constructed a search engine to find strings in text files utilizing C++. The program had to parse through text files, index the words and authors of the files into an AVL Tree, and search through the tree to locate files that the user searches for. By completing this project I gained valuable skills in Data Structures, Search Algorithms, Communication, and Teamwork.</p> -->
<p>During my Mobile Sensing and Learning class, I had the opportunity to create a mobile app of my choosing for the final project. What I created was a fitness based game called <i>Monster Trainer</i>, where users would level up their characters (monsters) by meeting the fitness goals set for them in the app. This project has given me valuabel skills in Mobile User Interface Design, Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, as well as Problem Solving and Creativity.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>The app has multiple functions that the user can utilize. The features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The user can select their monster that they would like to train</li>
    <li>The goals set by th app are visible from the home page, as well as the mosnter they have chosen</li>
    <li>They can view the stats of their monster as well as a brief description of it by tapping on it</li>
    <li>Fitness statistics such as the amount of stairs they climbed, steps they have taken, etc are displayed in the fitness tracking section</li>
    <li>The user can see all of the monsters in the game, as well as their stats and a brief description</li>
    <li>Lastly, the user can battle AI opponents with their chosen monster</li>
</ul>
