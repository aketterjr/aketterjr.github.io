<!-- <p>For this project, I constructed a search engine to find strings in text files utilizing C++. The program had to parse through text files, index the words and authors of the files into an AVL Tree, and search through the tree to locate files that the user searches for. By completing this project I gained valuable skills in Data Structures, Search Algorithms, Communication, and Teamwork.</p> -->
<p>During my Mobile Sensing and Learning class, I had the opportunity to create a mobile app of my choosing for the final project. What I created was a fitness based game called <i>Monster Trainer</i>, where users would level up their characters (monsters) by meeting the fitness goals set for them in the app. This project has given me valuable skills in Mobile User Interface Design, Mobile Sensing of Data, as well as Problem Solving and Creativity. Lastly, it should be noted that all of the visual assets in the game were drawn by me on my iPad in Procreate.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>The app has multiple functions that the user can utilize. The features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The user can select their monster that they would like to train</li>
    <li>The goals set by th app are visible from the home page, as well as the mosnter they have chosen</li>
    <li>They can view the stats of their monster as well as a brief description of it by tapping on it</li>
    <li>Fitness statistics such as the amount of stairs they climbed, steps they have taken, etc are displayed in the fitness tracking section</li>
    <li>The user can see all of the monsters in the game, as well as their stats and a brief description</li>
    <li>Lastly, the user can battle AI opponents with their chosen monster</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selecting Your Monster</h2>
<p>When the player first enters the game, they will be given the choice of three monsters for them to train. By clicking on each of the eggs, they can see what the monsters are inside. The app also displays a little animation to make the creatures come to life.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The character selection screen of the game</span>

<p>Once the player selects their monster, they can move on to the main menu of the application.</p>

<h2>Main Menu</h2>
<p>In the menu of the application, the user can see the monster they have selected, as well as a range of different icons. Above the monster on the left hand side are the goals that the application sets for the user. These are calculated by taking their pedometer data for the past few days and plugging them into a function. Completing these goals will award the user XP for their monster, adding to the bar seen directly below the goals.</p>

<p>In addition to the basic goal that the app sets for the user (the blue bar), there is also a "stretch goal" that is intended to push the user in their fitness journey. The stretch goal is the bar in red.</p>

<p>The other three icons on the side track the user's fitness data, their monster collection, and the option to battle, all of which will be outlined further below.</p>

<h2>Fitness Statistics</h2>

<p>The first option is the fitness statistics. Here the user can see how many steps they have taken, the number of fleights of stairs they've climbed, and the total distance they have walked for the past week. This let's the user see their progress and track their goals.</p>

<h2>Monster Collection</h2>

<p>The next screen is the monster collection, which shows the user all of the monsters in the game, as well as their stats and a brief description. The monsters that the user did not choose will appear with a lock icon indicating that they cannot be used.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Monster Collection (Egg Icon)</span>

<h2>Battle</h2>

<p>The last function of the application is battling against AI opponents. These battles will use the stats of the monster to determine the outcome in turn based combat. There are also simple animations to show the progress of the battle, although this is one area that could be improved in future iterations.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Overall, this project was a great lesson in Mobile UI Design, Mobile Sensing, and Creativity. I had to design the user interface myself by starting with story boards and then moving into implementation, which provided an interesting challenge. Furthermore, I applied my skills in reading in the phones data that it collects, and applying that to an app in an interesting way. Lastly, I exercised my creative muscles by not only drawing all of the games assets, but coming up with the concept in the first place. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience in executing on a solo coding project on a tight time frame (6 days).</p>
