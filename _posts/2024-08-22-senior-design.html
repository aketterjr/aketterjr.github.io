<p>During my senior year of college, I had the opportunity to be a part of a group project where we created a mobile application that was pitched by an SMU business student. This was a great opportunity to gain experience with React Native, TypeScript and AWS, as well as working on a team of programmers, and working with a client/gathering requirements.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Background Information</h2>

<p>Senior Design is a class offered at SMU where students partner with a sponsor to work on software over the course of their senior year. I joined the class for the second semester and was placed into a group with a project already in progress. Our sponsor was a business student at SMU who pitched a social fitness application called "Spotter".</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Technical Skills Gained</h2>

<p>By working on this project I gained valuable skills in React Native, TypeScript and Amazon Web Services. I also learned about how to build more complex systems using a shared codebase. All of these skills have proven useful in my current projects.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Teamwork Experience</h2>

<p>In addition to the technical knowledge I gained, I also gained valuable experience in working as a team. My team and I coordinated our Sprints using Jira and would have meetings with our sponsor frequently to adjust requirements. Working on this project was a good introduction to Agile project development, and I had a great time working with my team.</p>
