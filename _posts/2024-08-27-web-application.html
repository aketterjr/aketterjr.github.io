<p>My latest project that I am working on is a website where people can not only read comic books as well as novels, but can also leave comments or discuss on forums their favorite books. This will involve many technical challenges such as building a front end and a back end then finally linking the two. I am excited about the opportunity to undertake this challenge, as I enjoy reading comics and regular books in my free time. For the latest progress updates, see the github link below.</p>
